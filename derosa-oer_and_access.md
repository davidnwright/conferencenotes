  When I note here, it is my thinking... when I am quoting DeRosa, I will mark it as such; otherwise it is me thinking.

- What about how students who pick and choose textbooks based on program? students purchase  books according to the need or major?

- [Florida virtual campus survey](http://www.openaccesstextbooks.org/pdf/2012_Florida_Student_Textbook_Survey.pdf). How is it that 67% do not buy the textbook but only 38% earned a poor grade and only 20% failed the course. 
	- What about the ten percent who did fine? 
	- We should key in on those people. 

- How much longer do textbooks have? Should we not come up with the long term plan for their obsolescence?

- "Give me back to the tools for our learning. A terrible model for learning" (DeRosa)  -- speaking of textbook rentals

- What type of learning are we improving? 
- Accessible / Learner-Driven / Community / Public /

**Learner-Driven: How People Learn**

- **What is the obligation of the student? When must they commit or have a stake in their own learning? Particularly when we consider service-learning courses... very different than what a program would require.**
	- What is the learning outcome for the development of learner-centred approaches, if they get it wrong? We assume that they will get it right, but what about those instances when they get the policy wrong?
	- Grading themselves and what are the learning outcomes when they ignore the facts?
	- **NFI -- not fucking interested... students are often NFI about these things? Hard not to get demoralized.**
	- You are requiring a certain level of engagement with learner-driven content that does not bear out in my experience--particularly because of the service-level courses that most Adjuncts and non-tenured (the most vulnerable) tend to teach.
