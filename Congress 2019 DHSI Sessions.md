JUNE 4 - SESSION I - COUNTER MAPPING

- Counter narratives to prevailing thoughts - i.e.: Brazil is an example of environmental sustainability
	- Brazil preserves its natural world -- sustains the forest by integrating conservation into its practices. 

- Could frame this in truth course -- opposite provocations. 
- Mapping *Maus* -- follow the logic of the journey in real spaces
- Mapping as highly positional; representations of perspective... map in multiple spaces
	- You might need to set the database... they can map it, but you need to provide it

- *The Social Live Of Forests* - Hecht

Unsettling Colonial Cartography

- Treaty Six - Northern Alberta
- Campuses that rest on traditional territory -- an interesting gambit on colonial practice -- we literary over-write the land. 
- place - making
- sonic difference and colonial over-writing -- the sound of industry over-writes the traditional soundscape
- sweetgrass bear statue
- Deep Listening - Oliveros, P (*Collected Writings*)
- Voegelin, Salom√©. *Sonic Possible Worlds: Hearing a Continuum of Sound*
- What does the Treaty look like to the different people who sign it -- long as the rivers flow, etc., vs. surrender
- McAdam, S. *Nationhood Interrupted*
- Tobacco as demonized by colonialism... what was once sacred is now a terror. 
- Really interested in these differences of interpretation... so how meaning is fixed by the dominant perspective. 
	- Stuart Hall - power will win the definition -- see Tabacco
	
- Goeman, Mashuana.	 *Mark My Words: Native Women mapping our nations*
	-  "(re)mapping moves towards geographies that do not limit,  contain, or fix the various scales of space from the body to the nation."

- biodiversity in sound--what gets represented? 
- archives are always representative of power
- the mediation of the sounds -- what role does the microphone or the "mix" play in the record? How is that representative of power? How is this decolonizing? How do you know when you have the hot-take.
- Combine the two projects above... audio recordings of environmentally protected areas.
- elimination of wind for instance... the "authenticity" of the sound
- A micorphoen from 1915 records different than one that records now... also, if we record now through 1915 microphone our reality is different...
	- DISTORTIONS
	- 
- the fragility of the embodied space when we record -- has meaning to the listener, but not the originator.
