Notes from Session on Pedagogy. 
10:15 - Friday May 17

**Rhizomatic Bit**

- Shaping of experiences in the classroom
	- write words associate with YOUR cultural identity (blue note)
	- write words others have used to describe your cultural identity ((yellow note)
	- **one** classroom experience positive or negative that relates to those definitions of identity. (cue card) -- presumably longer answer expected here. 
	- Speak about what you have written -- in pairs first and then to the group more expansively
		- DOES THIS ACTIVITY "OUT" PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE "OUTED"
- Working with resistance -- 
- I like the idea of identifying difference -- maybe this is an in-class where you could take the same approach to character, setting, etc., perhaps 
- what about accent--speaking--as identifier 
- there are complicated histories about us.

- What does it mean to create clubs and identities -- clubs, club tables, student groups -- through ethnicities?
- colonized imagination
- how might I teach resistance to the texts themselves... not what are the standards, but how do these texts not meet your standards? Resist the colonial reading and move more to the "new" reading. 
- **"Projective Reading" -- read through resistance**
- Teach through resistance -- using the idea above. 
- Interesting to see them leave the people in the room with an actionable -- "what will you do in your home institution to incorporate what we discussed?"

**Decolonizing In Australia**

- [Robin DiAngelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege#White_fragility) 
- forum for learning and sharing, indignity. 
- critical reflection -- revitalization
- watch out for the black vs. white experience -- reductive to the other ways of speaking as legitimate
- what the fuck is "emplacement"? - this has something to do with a gun battery -- odd terminology; I suppose they mean it to work as a kind of "where we're coming from"
- what the fuck is ["positionality"?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_theory)
- do you want to be patient or pushy?

**Computer Science**

- the domain sets the paradigm for learning
