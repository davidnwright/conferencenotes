Notes from Session on Pedagogy. 
10:15 - Friday May 17

**Rhizomatic Bit**

- Shaping of experiences in the classroom
	- write words associate with YOUR cultural identity (blue note)
	- write words others have used to describe your cultural identity ((yellow note)
	- **one** classroom experience positive or negative that relates to those definitions of identity. (cue card) -- presumably longer answer expected here. 
	- Speak about what you have written -- in pairs first and then to the group more expansively
		- DOES THIS ACTIVITY "OUT" PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE "OUTED"
- Working with resistance -- 
- I like the idea of identifying difference -- maybe this is an in-class where you could take the same approach to character, setting, etc., perhaps 
- what about accent--speaking--as identifier 
- there are complicated histories about us. 

---

- What does it mean to create clubs and identities -- clubs, club tables, student groups -- through ethnicities?
- colonized imagination
- how might I teach resistance to the texts themselves... not what are the standards, but how do these texts not meet your standards? Resist the colonial reading and move more to the "new" reading. 
- **"Projective Reading" -- read through resistance**
- Teach through resistance -- using the idea above. 
- Interesting to see them leave the people in the room with an actionable -- "what will you do in your home institution to incorporate what we discussed?"

--- 

**Decolonizing In Australia**

- [Robin DiAngelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege#White_fragility) 
- forum for learning and sharing, indignity. 
- critical reflection -- revitalization
- watch out for the black vs. white experience -- reductive to the other ways of speaking as legitimate
- what the fuck is "emplacement"? - this has something to do with a gun battery -- odd terminology; I suppose they mean it to work as a kind of "where we're coming from"
- what the fuck is ["positionality"?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standpoint_theory)
- do you want to be patient or pushy?

---

**Computer Science**

- the domain sets the paradigm for learning
- [**Susan Ambrose -- How Learning Works**](https://firstliteracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/How-Learning-Works.pdf)
- Intellectual, social, Emotional, Physical space
- Tsukada, Perreault [COMPLICATING HOW CLASSROOM CLIMATE WORKS: ADVANCING THE FRAMEWORK (2016)](https://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/Transformative%20Dialogues/TD.9.2.2_Tsukada%26Perreault_Advancing_the_Framework.pdf) -- page 8
- Reciprocity / Witnessing
- Foregrounding the voices within minority voices
- [dotstorming](https://dotstorming.com/)
- who is under-represented
- tablets of stone:

**Move Slow and Decolonize**

- foundations
- contexts
- research projects -- an outcome report
-

**Day 2**

--- 

**12:30 Plenary -- Land-ing: City Land Based Knowledges for those on the move**

- "The M Archive" Book that inspired the talk -- interesting the archive as collection of imagined futures. 
- Naming
- Archive "After the end of the World" - a series of poetic archives--M archive? 
- (link)[https://www.google.com/search?q=M+archives+pauline&oq=M+archives+pauline&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.8231j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8]
- Land vocabularies as motion-based, land as a series of relationships
- There's a real like here between Blackness and Indignity 
- **Choreographies of the Fall**
- **Cloudscape *Hannah Claus***
- Indigi-futurism -- honours a geneology of Afro-Futurism
- Themes of diaspora, spiders, architectural conduits, orientation devices (CN Tower)
	- I like this idea of orientation devices	-- maybe use this as a conceptual root. 
- Collage as a technology to reconfgiure new elements in spaces that have been forgotten, acknlwedlges of the integrity of substrata. 
- Joanna Hern
- Making kin with machines... tilt brush... loss of grounding... shifting
- EMBODIED Provocations -- thinking about this as the underlying colonial currents
- "What do we do as we are born of rupture?"
- David Garno -- indigineous thinking... worn and carried... in display and dialogues with others 
- **Myth that Indigineous as wanting to move... they are not always rooted in a specific land... they might be movers... settled or landed Indigineity... land-based does not have to mean land-locked.**
- **Decolonial bodysematic practioner.**
- **futurity bundles** Maria Hupfield
- What do we put in the futurity bundle? -- This is an interesting concept... of thinking about these bundles... vessles that refuse settlement, stillment
- Bundling is a technology for landing
- Sylvia McAdam 77 -- The Blackfoot scout carries a painted rod with a small bundle made of hide tied to the top of the rod. The small bundle carries kinnikanik, "sacred tobacco" to many of the nations. He walks purposely toward an invisible line and places the painted rod deep into the ground bordering the nehiyaw [Cree] territory. [paraphrase]: he comes back the next morning after camping out overnight waiting and finds the rod but nothing else. He is allowed to cross the border.

- time and land -- a diaspora
- Cree theories of motion...  the idea that intelligence moves around... taking people around... move their intelligence to make them able to take flight. Not "in care" but rather as a way forward...
- adoption stories... \
	*- Maybe do a spellcheck exercise that looks at the constrictions of terms... how much red is enough...*
- **In kinship rather than Care**

So many times, speakers have interrupted themselves to ask about pronounciation

---

**Open Knowledge from Whom**  

- What are my responsibilities for who I am and for the people to whom I belong
- Wikipedia as governed by the North... what sources are missing here? Who is not represented... 1130 as asking the questions: "what is knowledge"
- Gaps in knowledge filled by White Colonial elements... revising histories, revisiting histories. This might be especially true in terms of emerging technologies... who is putting forward the "new"?
- Ownership as an issue in terms of legacy colonial ownership... whose media is it? 
- resistance
- SO much of the future spaces are inspired by African American Diaspora... Black history, Black revolution.

- **How would you shift the value in things that already exist... redesign infrastructures... what does Google Maps do? And then, what set of values could you replace that with--reciprocity, environmental responsibility, etc.**

- Reframing the value that governs the output seems like a really good idea. 

- Wikipedia, tribal pages are framed in the past tense. Change the tense... change the language (primitive). 
- Allies as gnomic approach -- little changes make big changes... 

- acknowledge the absences.... that's what i want students to leave with in the end. 
- Thinking about spaces for oral knowledge
- Communal approval instead of peer review...
- Who gets to share the stories -- thinking about museums as the primary storytellers... how do we acknowledge the stroytellor in the digital space...
- Book that has an agreement in front of it, something from this morning... you enter and it is the space of acknowledgement... 
	- A space for Sharing Stories... Darcy Cullen, .... 
- **"Ally toolkit" that is online**
- MURKUTU CMS
