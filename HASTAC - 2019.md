Notes from Session on Pedagogy. 
10:15 - Friday May 17

**Rhizomatic Bit**

- Shaping of experiences in the classroom
	- write words associate with YOUR cultural identity (blue note)
	- write words others have used to describe your cultural identity ((yellow note)
	- **one** classroom experience positive or negative that relates to those definitions of identity. (cue card) -- presumably longer answer expected here. 
	- Speak about what you have written -- in pairs first and then to the group more expansively
		- DOES THIS ACTIVITY "OUT" PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE "OUTED"
- Working with resistance -- 
- I like the idea of identifying difference -- maybe this is an in-class where you could take the same approach to character, setting, etc., perhaps 
- what about accent--speaking--as identifier 
- there are complicated histories about us.
