**Open Education 2015, Vancouver Fairmont Hotel, Nov. 18, 2015**  
**Day One**  

----

**Multi-Access session was interesting in how it approached the multimodality of the classroom.**  
  
- How can these spaces be more than one mode?
- How can these spaces be open when things are in fact constricted?
- Online and Distance Education often coupled, which is an issue. 
- Lots of interesting stuff in there about expectations of instructors... not sure about the assumptions... there's a lot here that doesn't necessarily reflect direct contact outside discipline of information science. 

----

**SPLOT Session**  

- same old same old, thinking about sandboxing and how we roll out the system
- nice to meet cogdog in person
- thoughts about how you roll things like this out and how you target the audience

----

**Publishing the Self Session**  

- How students use the blogspace and do so as an open access
- Thinking about assessment as a challenge in open spaces
- What is the personal cyberstructure?
- Linking and being linked to--and the anxiety around this process

**ROER4D Session**

- I know nothing about this... about researching OER in the open - focus on the Global North
- [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/ROER4D)
- IDRC funding - many countries
- focusing on the adoption and so on of OER 
	- adopted well in some countries, some countries completely unknown
	- define what we mean by open research ... struggle for definitions
- How did we go about the research
- Process of conducting and sharing research
- Everything in the open - proposals, data, everything for others to access
- 4 Key Dimensions:
	- ideological openness - belief that openness in research can add value

This seems to be where a lot of people are getting their assumptions about #opened.

**Faculty Attitudes towards OER and open textbooks in British Columbia and beyond**

- Focus on open textbooks
- Faculty -- changing the relationship that faculty have with the learning resources in the classroom - attitudinal change
- Why choose to adopt / challenges / futures?
- What they know so far:
	- Came out too fast to grasp, but mostly based on surveys of instructors and students using OER... no definition of what OER is... using it as a noun. But could mean many things... 78 respondents from 18 institutions -- mostly from research intensive universities... over 50% from universities... 
	- people who have not adopted OER think it sucks
	- No definition of OER... like does it include flipping the classroom? What is open that doesn't involve a textbook? 
- Some interesting pics:

- This talk trucks in OER, but it is really about open textbooks only.
- White paper around institutional support and adoption, coming soon. 

- What is OER in the figuring here--it needs to be much clearer in order to make this coherent. 
	- They have broad-based data on this other stuff, which is great.

**RIP Print -- well not so fast**

- This group is representing College retail outlets. 
- Not many students wanting a digital textbook - most revert to print
	- "depends on the course" - I wonder what the dependencies are? Why do they answer thus?
- As they gain experience with, they will adopt....
- Interactivity seems to be a selling point - is this really true? 
- You need a print option
- More references to OER as a textbook only...
- OPENStax
- Main criteria
	- How may students? How expensive? 

----

**The Economics of Open**

- lumen
- sustainability, funding, models, hard questions
- create course for adopting faculty members with full SR privileges
	- support for BB and Canvas
- American perspective
- Extra fee on the course -- this pays for the hosting process of Lumen
- Wikipedia definition of Economics of Public Good (non-excludable and non-rivalrous vs. Free Riders, or the opposite)
- why would private companies invest in something that others are not forced to pay for...
- A good corporate citizen:
	- Give back to the community at a level commensurate with the benefit it receives
	- Provide some unique value add
	- Create transparency in what it uses, contributes and monetizes
- Keep dialogue between public and private 
- Companies:
	- Aggregate funding (revenue) from across a broad number of organizations receiving tangible benefit
	- invest with complete flexibility
	- Bring investment from different sources
- Funding going forward:
	- Lumen is the poster child for replacing grant funding with sustainable revenue...
	- Community funding... support for the work... 
- Amazon hosting model for Lumen's MyOpenMath's future... couldn't do that here.
- Lots of fundamental questions about societal role in this process -- grant funding goes down... 
- Lots of questions about our educational inefficiencies that cause funding shortfalls to occur. 
- Philanthropic dollars used like venture capital 
	- This assumes that venture capital isn't inefficient or that it is a just funding model. No evidence that it is...

**Making Online Education Accessible to the Six Billion People without laptops or broadband**  

This session was very late in starting... 

- Online education isn't accessible
- Is mobile the solution?
- Online is typically
	- Broadband (wifi at home)
	- Laptop or desktop
- Broadband penetration is 11% globally
- By 2020 over 80% internet users will be accessing the internet through mobile devices and mobile broadband.

- move to mobile is good
- Data huge barrier for MOOCs
- Much but not all web content will work on mobile

- online work offline - 
- .Isn file - .zip file that containt he media. 
- narrated presentations rather than videos - 24 seconds per frame not 24 frames per second
- vector video / vectorized video / vector files .svg files
- give them scratch exercises... make them do stuff rather than watch something
-  interactive is a better experience for students

- html apps - static apps
- openblocks import
- free to use public library of blocks / grains
- dot learn - a file format for online education
- teach[x] something that integrates everything together...

Most inspiring talk yet... Samrat Bhattacharyya (MIT)

**For Who, For what? Not-yetness and challenging the "stuff" of open education**

[slides](http://www.slideshare.net/amcollier/for-whom-for-what-notyetness-and-challenging-the-stuff-of-open-education)

- "Not-yetness" as a way of defining and predicting
- Open Access manifesto
- Oliver on Openess (2015)  - "technologically mediated openness..."
- Knox 2013 - The effectiveness of OER is frequently articulated in terms of the ability.."
- Olakulehehin and Singh 2013
- "all forms of openness entail forms of closed-ness" (Edwards 2015 p. 255)- neat the way closed-ness is opened by the hyphen
- diversity... that's a missing piece in all this. 
- push back on assumptions of dichotomies (open vs. closed)
- not yet-ness
	- no yet fully understood
	- not yet fully researched in a meaningful way
	- Veletsianos, 2012
- issues in open education as issues in digital education (as above)
- Bayne 2014
- Borders... Gloria Anzaldua - Borderlands

- Good questions to be asked in here about the definitions of open.

**Creating a Culture of Innovation**

- Wondering seriously how lumen has used this conference as a platform for sales
- This was useless, except as a pitch for Lumen and a need for system oversight
