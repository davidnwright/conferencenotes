JUNE 4 - SESSION I - COUNTER MAPPING

- Counter narratives to prevailing thoughts - i.e.: Brazil is an example of environmental sustainability
	- Brazil preserves its natural world -- sustains the forest by integrating conservation into its practices. 

- Could frame this in truth course -- opposite provocations. 
- Mapping *Maus* -- follow the logic of the journey in real spaces
- Mapping as highly positional; representations of perspective... map in multiple spaces
	- You might need to set the database... they can map it, but you need to provide it

- *The Social Live Of Forests* - Hecht
